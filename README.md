# Burger Time

This app lets users add burgers to the app menu and update when the burger has been devoured. Burger data is stored in a MySQL databse. Vegetarians might want to look away... Burger Time is brought to you by Express Handlebars and deployed on Heroku with JawsDB MySQL. [Check it out](https://floating-bayou-84786.herokuapp.com/).
